### Selected Projects

- **Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2025)**:  
Collaborated with Kwaai, an open-source AI lab, to study privacy-preserving query methods for vector databases in Personal AI. Explored encryption techniques like dimensional scrambling, noise injection, ElGamal, and CKKS, and developed and evaluated new homomorphic encryption algorithms.

- **Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2024)**:  
Analyzed Vironix Health’s de-identified datasets on disease progression during remote patient monitoring to identify positive health outcomes and predict adverse episodes, patient compliance, and engagement.

- **Erdős Institute Data Science Boot Camp (Fall 2023)**:  
Built predictive models to forecast S&P 500 index behavior and compared results across stock indices.

- **Wolfram|Alpha (Summer 2023)**:  
Contributed to a project extracting and validating mathematical assertions from scientific papers, using LaTeX parsing, pattern matching, and regular expressions.

- **Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2022)**:  
Collaborated with Vironix Health to conducted exploratory data analysis of hospital admission data to identify key features and symptoms predictive of heart failure severity.

- **Graduate Student Math Modeling Camp (GSMMC 2022)**:  
Analyzed geospatial travel data to balance transparency, privacy, and utility using statistical and randomization methods.

- **Erdős Institute Data Science Boot Camp (Summer 2021)**:  
Used predictive modeling (KNN, Decision Trees, SVMs) to identify success factors in clinical trials for cancer interventions.
