### Selected Projects

- **Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2024)**  
  Analyzed de-identified datasets from Vironix Health to study disease progression in patients undergoing remote monitoring. Explored predictors of adverse events, patient compliance, and engagement.

- **Erdős Institute Data Science Boot Camp (Fall 2023)**  
  Built predictive models to forecast the behavior of the S&P 500 index, comparing performance across multiple models and indices.

- **Wolfram|Alpha (Summer 2023)**  
  Contributed to a project extracting and validating mathematical assertions from scientific papers. Ensured accurate LaTeX parsing, reduced error messages using pattern matching, regular expressions, and string manipulations.

- **Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2022)**  
  Performed exploratory data analysis on hospital admission data to uncover features and patterns relevant to heart failure prediction and severity classification.

- **Graduate Student Math Modeling Camp (GSMMC 2022)**  
  Modeled trade-offs between geospatial data transparency, privacy, and utility using statistical methods and randomization techniques.

- **Erdős Institute Data Science Boot Camp (Summer 2021)**  
  Identified key factors in successful cancer clinical trials using K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and support vector machines.
