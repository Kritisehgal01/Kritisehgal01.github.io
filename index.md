Thank you for your interest! I am currently a Preceptor in Data Science at the [Data Science Institute (DSI)](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). My position is a collaboration between [Univeristy of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) and [City Colleges of Chicago](https://www.ccc.edu/).

Prior to joining DSI, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from [The Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/) and Masters in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://math.iisc.ac.in//).
