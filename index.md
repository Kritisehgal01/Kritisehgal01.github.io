## Welcome to my homepage!

Thank you for your interest! I am currently a Preceptor in Data Science at the [Data Science Institute (DSI)](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. My position is a collaboration between the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) and the [City Colleges of Chicago](https://www.ccc.edu/).

While pursuing my PhD, I explored the emerging field of data science through coursework at OSU, as well as bootcamps and workshops hosted by the [Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/). This exploration, combined with my passion for teaching, led me to my current role.
