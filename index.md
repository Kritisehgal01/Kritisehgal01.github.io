## Welcome to my homepage!

Thank you for your interest! I am currently a Preceptor in Data Science at the <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Data Science Institute (DSI)</a> at the University of Chicago. My position is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="https://www.ccc.edu/" target="_blank">City Colleges of Chicago</a>.

During my time as a PhD student, I explored the emerging field of data science through courses at OSU, bootcamps and workshops at the <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Erd≈ës Institute</a>. This combined with my passion towards teaching led me to my current position.
