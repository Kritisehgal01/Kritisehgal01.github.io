## Welcome to my homepage!

Thank you for your interest! I am currently a Preceptor in Data Science at the <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Data Science Institute (DSI)</a> at the University of Chicago. My position is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="https://www.ccc.edu/" target="_blank">City Colleges of Chicago</a>.

Prior to joining DSI, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from [The Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/) and Masters in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://math.iisc.ac.in//).
