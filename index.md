# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Iâ€™m **Kriti Sehgal** â€” a mathematician, data scientist, and inclusive STEM educator.

I recently completed my PhD in mathematics at The Ohio State University. My teaching centers around accessibility and inclusion, particularly for historically marginalized communities in STEM. I also work with data in ways that reflect human values â€” in and beyond the classroom.
