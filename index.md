## Welcome to my homepage!

Thank you for your interest! I am currently a Preceptor in Data Science at the <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Data Science Institute (DSI)</a> at the University of Chicago. My position is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="https://www.ccc.edu/" target="_blank">City Colleges of Chicago</a>.

While pursuing my PhD, I explored the emerging field of data science through coursework at OSU, as well as bootcamps and workshops hosted by the <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Erdős Institute</a>. This exploration, combined with my passion for teaching, led me to my current role.
