* At DSI, I am collaborating with <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/internet-innovation/" target="_blank"> Internet Innovation</a> initiative to understand changes in the broadband measurement parameters. 

* My doctoral work had two major components: 
    - Constructing a robust theoretical framework to explain the long-term dynamics of the extensively studied Hénon-Heiles system

    - Extending the application of Plemelj's formulas from Hölder continuous functions to the broader domain of Dini continuous functions and studying the domain of existence of Cauchy P.V. integrals.
